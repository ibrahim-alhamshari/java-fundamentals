**In my repository I have the following folders, every folder have an application**
### 1. basics

> In this application I have:
1. A function called `pluralize` that accepts a word and a number and returns a string with the word pluralized with an “s” if the number is zero, or greater than one.

2. A function called `flipNHeads` that accepts an integer n and flips coins until n heads are flipped in a row.
- Simulate coin flipping by choosing a random number between 0 and 1. Numbers below .5 are considered tails. Numbers at and above .5 are considered heads.
- This application will print out heads or tails on one line for each flip.
- Finally will print `It took ${number of flipping} flips to flip ${n} head in a row.`

3. A function to print the current time (Oclock).

### 2. basiclibrary

> In this application I have:
1. **Rolling Dice:** It's a  method called *roll* that accepts an integer `n` and rolls a six-sided dice `n` times. The method returns an array containing the values of the rolls.
2. **Contains Duplicates:** A method that returns *true* or *false* depending on whether the array contains duplicate values.
3. **Calculating Averages:**  A method that accepts an array of integers and calculates and returns the average of all the values in the array.

4. **Arrays of Arrays:** We pass to this method an array of arrays , then it calculate the average value for each array and return the array with the lowest average.

### 3. linter
> This application read your JS files and if there any error caused by missing semicolon , it will till you in any line there is missing semicolon. So, make sure to add all the semicolons to your Js code.

### 4. inheritance
> This application enables you to add restaurants and enable you also to add reviews to each restaurant, the review contains your name and your feedback, and the rate to that restaurant.
> I used the composition to make a relationship between the `Restaurant` class with the `Review` class without inheritance.
> I inherited only the default method which is (toString() method).
> Finally, I tested my functions on the part of testing by adding the inspected values with the running of the functions to ensure that I have the same results or not.
