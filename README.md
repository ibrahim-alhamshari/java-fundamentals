**In my repository I have the following folders, every folder have an application**
### 1. basics

> In this application I have:
1. A function called `pluralize` that accepts a word and a number and returns a string with the word pluralized with an “s” if the number is zero, or greater than one.

2. A function called `flipNHeads` that accepts an integer n and flips coins until n heads are flipped in a row.
- Simulate coin flipping by choosing a random number between 0 and 1. Numbers below .5 are considered tails. Numbers at and above .5 are considered heads.
- This application will print out heads or tails on one line for each flip.
- Finally will print `It took ${number of flipping} flips to flip ${n} head in a row.`

3. A function to print the current time (Oclock).

### 2. basiclibrary

> In this application I have:
1. **Rolling Dice:** It's a  method called *roll* that accepts an integer `n` and rolls a six-sided dice `n` times. The method returns an array containing the values of the rolls.
2. **Contains Duplicates:** A method that returns *true* or *false* depending on whether the array contains duplicate values.
3. **Calculating Averages:**  A method that accepts an array of integers and calculates and returns the average of all the values in the array.

4. **Arrays of Arrays:** We pass to this method an array of arrays , then it calculate the average value for each array and return the array with the lowest average.
