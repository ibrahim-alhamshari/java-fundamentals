### Java Primitives and Control Flow

> In this repository I have:
1. A function called `pluralize` that accepts a word and a number and returns a string with the word pluralized with an “s” if the number is zero, or greater than one.

2. A function called `flipNHeads` that accepts an integer n and flips coins until n heads are flipped in a row.
- Simulate coin flipping by choosing a random number between 0 and 1. Numbers below .5 are considered tails. Numbers at and above .5 are considered heads.
- This application will print out heads or tails on one line for each flip.
- Finally will print `It took ${number of flipping} flips to flip ${n} head in a row.`

3. A function to print the current time (Oclock).
